1. What do I do about the prepositions after words that are commonly used to form phrases ( ila, b, etc. )
2. Do I add each word as a separate model (which could lead to reverse querying), or dump the words in as a 'definitions' field. (Could always parse out later)
3. WTF do I do about defective root craziness? (d3w has three roots? depends on the short vowels?)
4. What do all those symbols mean before and after words?
5. What do I do about nouns, that are mapped but don't have roots.
6. What do I do about common phrases that are added but not words.
7. What do you do with entries that have an alif ending / waaw ending / yaa ending listed... Which one is it?
8. Difference between words with hamza on alif as medial root, and hamza on yaa. Must be the short vowels?
9. What does look up alphabetically mean?
10. What to do with roots that have multiple meanings ( one meaning 2 forms, then another meaning with another 2 forms etc. )
11. What does d.o after form V mean... How is a verb the direct object?

- I think that the short vowel IS part of the root of the word... and thus you need to do 'candidates' and show both / pick the best one according to some metric
