1. What do I do about the prepositions after words that are commonly used to form phrases ( ila, b, etc. )
2. Do I add each word as a separate model (which could lead to reverse querying), or dump the words in as a 'definitions' field. (Could always parse out later)
3. WTF do I do about defective root craziness? (d3w has three roots? depends on the short vowels?)
4. What do all those symbols mean before and after words?
5. What do I do about nouns, that are mapped but don't have roots.
6. What do I do about common phrases that are added but not words.
