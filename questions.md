1. What does "VI = V" at the end of a definition mean, such as in the "hi-k-l" entry on page 27

2. What the fuck is going on with "r", "hmz", "y" ( to see ) on page 368

3. How can I represent a shadda on top of a short vowel? Perhaps there are unicode characters for it and I'm just unaware of it atm

4. I thought that the jussive WAS the imperative, but my grammar book has them listed differently. ALONG with the passive voices being listed differently as well. Are these really different conjugations?
